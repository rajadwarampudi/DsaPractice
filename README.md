I am publishing this project for the potential employers to display my data structure and problem solving skills.

I have mostly simple to hard programming puzzles.

Instructions to build and test the solutions

The project is built using gradle. 
After cloning the repository use the following commands in cli
        * To Compile the project : "gradle compileJava"
        * To run unit testcases  : "gradle test"
        * To compile and test at the same time : "gradle build"
